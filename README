ActsAsTimecode
==============

A simple plugin to transform a field stored as seconds into a timecode in the format of HH:MM:SS.

The timecode can be set in any of the following formats:
HH:MM:SS:FF
HH:MM:SS
MM:SS
SS

Frames will be converted to seconds and rounded, based on the :fps value (default fps = 30)

Example
=======

class Video < ActiveRecord::Base
  acts_as_timecode :column => :duration
end

video.timecode = "01:23:45"
video.duration = 5025
